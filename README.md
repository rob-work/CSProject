Project planning: Technical development
---------------------------------------

Software development
All software development should follow an appropriate methodology, and this will be outlined in the project quality plan.

### H3 Requirements
UML (Unified Modelling Language) use cases, scenarios, and class diagrams will be used to express requirement/functional specifications.

Requirements will be baselined through the configuration management process to scope exactly what the software will do within each release - changes to requirements will follow the change control process defined by the project.

Requirements will be re-used in developing test plans and user documentation

Well-defined requirements will describe the softwareâ€™s externally-perceived functionality and properties. Requirements will be clear, complete, reasonably detailed, cohesive, attainable, and testable. A non-testable requirement would be 'user-friendly' (too subjective)

Should rapid development and agile development methods be used, the requirements will be refined through close interaction and cooperation between the programmer and users.

### H3 Design
Design of the logical/functional and physical/internal system will be expressed using UML
Good internal design will be demonstrated by software code whose overall structure is clear, understandable, easily modifiable, and maintainable; is robust with sufficient error-handling and status logging capability; and works correctly when implemented

### H3 Coding
Coding of software will follow the stated design.
Coding and annotation standards will be consistently applied.
The project will apply the standard for coding and annotation consistently as defined in the project quality plan.
Code will be modular, tidy and well-documented internally (annotated)

### H3 Quality control and audit processes
The quality control process will indicate:

When or at what stage testing will take place.
How it will be carried out.
How results/faults will be recorded.
At what level software will be tested.
Any testing tools that will be used.
The quality control process will be used as a high-level testing strategy. The audit process is the ability to trace back the tests/checks that have been performed as part of quality control. This is useful for tracing software faults and may be useful for the evaluator to review the rigour to which the software was constructed.

### H3 Change control and configuration management processes
The project will define and implement a change control and configuration management process to ensure:

Software and documentation is base-lined and version controlled.
Software and documentation is securely stored using GIT.
Intermediate versions of software are retained.
Changes to software and documentation will be controlled, authorised, and auditable.
Releases of software and documentation will be quality assured (i.e. tested, versioned, and documented).
Change control includes any changes to the project plan, scope, budget, specifications, requirements, deliverables, standard of quality, and timescale assessment. 
This will take the form of a weekly review, outlining progress and next actions.
Changes to the original project plan, software specification, or user requirements will be traceable via audit and the reasoning for that change clearly recorded in an issue log which records all issues, requests for change and software faults/off-specification (e.g. test failures, over due software components). 

Configuration management is the control of anything produced by the project (e.g. documents and software) providing the mechanism for managing, tracking, and keeping control of all the projects deliverables. This will take the form of a GIT repository that safely stores, versions, controls access to, and records status of the software.

### H3 Testing
Testing plans and cases will be produced during design based on requirements and design specifications.
Testing will cover unit, module, system, integration, load and user testing.
A range of testing methods/techniques will be used e.g. automated testing.
Testing procedures will be auditable, i.e. results, faults and fixes are recorded and traceable.
Testing forms part of the configuration management process as only after software has been tested/quality checked can it be versioned and stored/released.
Consideration will be given to the relevant standards compliancy and interoperability tests that need to be undertaken especially when developing standards based on open source software.

### H3 Documentation 
The project wil produce user, requirements, design, and system documentation in UML version 1.4.
Documentation will be produced throughout the life of a project, in line with the software development acting as an audit trail.
